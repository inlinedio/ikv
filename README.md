# IKV | Inlined Key-Value Store
IKV is a high-performance **fully-managed, embedded key-value** store for powering ML inference. It's unique design tradeoffs makes it perfect for accessing large key-value datasets with very low latency in a production setting. IKV is written in Rust, but provides SDKs to use it in **Go, Java and Python**.

#### Embedded & Blazing Fast
IKV is an eventually-consistent, partitioned **[embedded database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_database)** on top of a backend data layer. It can serve read requests without making any network calls, and provides **single-digit microsecond** P99 read latency from a clientâ€™s point-of-view. This is **100x faster than existing solutions like Redis**. (See [benchmarks](benchmarks--100x-faster-than-redis) below)

IKV is heavily optimized for read performance (latency/throughput):
 - In-memory with option to spill to local disk.
 - Designed for point-lookups ("hashtable/dictionary API").
 - No cold start problem or RPCs during cache misses.
 - No Garbage Collection. IKV is written in Rust, with thin clients in languages like Java, Go & Python.

#### Fully Managed
IKV is more than just a library - it handles all data management aspects for you. It provides "write once, read forever" semantics, i.e. data is fully persistent (stored in IKV cloud). It replicates data across your fleet of application containers (globally). IKV scales horizontally for large datasets (with partitions) and high read/write traffic (with replication). This makes IKV unique as compared to other "library-only" embedded databases (ex. LevelDB, RocksDB or LMDB).

In short, you get the performance benefits of embedded DB architecture, and all the ease & reliability of a cloud hosted client-server DB architecture.

#### Usecases for IKV
Typical usecases include recommendation-engines, ML inference (feature stores), information-retrieval related tasks or fast general-purpose caching (anything with tight latency requirements, and does not need strong read-after-write consistency or transactions).

## Benchmarks | 100x faster than Redis
IKV provides single-digit microsecond response-time at P99 and is 100x faster than Redis. Read our full benchmarking setup and report [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aDsS0V-AybpvXEwblBlahGLpKH5NmUmi6mTWGsbABGk/edit#heading=h.ey4ngxmm384e).

```

These benchmarks were performed by a multi-threaded client machine which made blocking calls to the underlying database. For a constant load (queries-per-second), we note down the response-time of both databases (avg/P99/etc). We tested "get" performance i.e. given a primary-key and a field/attribute name - fetch the field's value. IKV is inherently built for multithreaded use, for Redis we used a 16 shard, single-node Redis Cluster to ensure fairness. The report linked above has details about hardware and testing methodology.

## Developer Documentation
Detailed documentation about data-modeling, best practices and language specific SDKs and more: **[docs.inlined.io](http://docs.inlined.io)**

## Onboarding
IKV is an **[embedded database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_database)** on top of a backend data layer (**IKV Cloud**). You need an IKV cloud account and a provisioned IKV store to start using it in your application. All provisioning related communication can be done by contacting **onboarding@inlined.io**. Store provisioning takes 1-3 hours.

## Pricing
Unlimited read quota, pay only for the amount of data you store ($ per GB/month). We offer a free-tier for small data volumes.
Pricing details can be requested based on quota requirements by contacting **onboarding@inlined.io**

## Architecture
<p align="center">
    <img src="readme-img/architecture.png" alt="IKV Architecture Schematic">
</p>
IKV has a hybrid architecture wherein, the database reads are served from an embedded database but writes are persisted and propagated using a standalone service (i.e. IKV Cloud).

 1. **Reader/Writer Clients**: Distributed as language specific libraries, this is how users perform all CRUD operations. The writer client publishes the events to IKV Cloud, while the reader client queries the embedded database which is up-to-date with latest data (in near real-time).
 2. **IKV Cloud**: Gateway for write operations. It distributes incoming writes to readers using Kafka streams. It also serves other essential tasks like building index images periodically (for bootstrapping new readers), serving configuration, etc.
 3. **Embedded database**: Written in Rust, this component is the core database engine used by readers. Clients interface with this using foreign function interface (ex. JNI for Java). The key data structures include: (1) sharded memory-mapped files which store serialized field values (2) hash-table which indexes primary-keys versus "offsets" into the mmaps. This design enables highly concurrent key-value lookup. For most scenarios, all of the data will reside in RAM, providing high performance.

## APIs
In this section we go over some important interfaces and abstractions that IKV provides as a key-value database. 

These concepts are language independent. IKV stores documents (the "value") associated with primary-keys (the "key"), in an [eventually consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency) (read-after-write) manner. Given a primary-key, a user can do CRUD operations i.e. create/read/update/delete for a single document (batch operations are also supported).

##### Document
A document is a collection of fields/attributes. Each inner field/attribute contained within a document is optional (i.e. it's value can be missing), and can be used to store a particular property of the document. This is analogous to a "single row" of data in many SQL databases or something like DynamoDB, with each "column" being an inner field/attribute. 

A field can be uniquely identified by a **name** and a **type** - which is the same across all documents stored in a particular IKV store. Fields (except primary and partitioning keys) are not required to be declared while provisioning or in a "schema/configuration" file, instead IKV updates field information dynamically as and when they are encountered at runtime.

##### Field Types
Supported types include - 
 - **Numeric**: int32, int64, float32, float64 - Can be used to store signed integer and floating point numbers of size 4 and 8 bytes.
 - **String**: A sequence of UTF8 characters. Language specific IKV clients generate functions/methods that use language specific types to represent strings (ex. `java.lang.String` in Java).
 - **Bytes**: A sequence of 8-bit values or raw bytes. This type is quite useful to model complex types. ex. 
	 - Storing a list of float64: which can be done by creating a custom encode/decoder which stores the number of float64's in the list followed by the actual floats as a fixed-width 8 byte entity.
	 - Storing complex/nested data: which can be done by leveraging serialization frameworks like Protobuf, Json, etc. - creating application specific objects and then converting them into raw bytes.

##### Primary Key
Primary Key is a unique identifier for a document and is itself a required field/attribute of the document. It can be of type string or bytes, and should be used for all CRUD operations on documents.

##### Partitioning Key
Since IKV is an embedded database, after a certain size all documents cannot fit in a single machine/host - hence partitioning keys are used to distribute documents across multiple hosts (i.e. partitions/shards). A user can declare an optional partitioning key (defaults to the primary key if missing), which itself is a required field/attribute of the document. It can be of type string or bytes. It is only relevant for write (create/update/delete) operations.

##### Operations
IKV supports the following operations on documents (for single/batch of documents) - 
 1. **Upsert**: Insert or Update-if-exists a document, given the document's fields (primary, partitioning keys and other fields). Upserts need not contain all field values as part of the same operation - fields get unionized to the same document, as and when they are published.
 2. **Delete**: Delete a document or specific fields from a document, given the document's primary and partitioning (if applicable) key.
 3. **Read**: Read a particular field(s) for a document, given its primary key. NOTE - Read operations are [eventually-consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency) w.r.t upsert and delete operations, i.e. there will be small delay (usually in order of milliseconds) before changes to a document's fields are reflected in read operations.
 
##### Illustration
Let's consider an example where we want to store user profile's in an IKV store called - *users*. A user profile contains their (1) first-name (2) age (3) city.

To represent this data-model, we first think of how our IKV document would look like. Each document can represent  a particular profile, which is uniquely identified by their *firstname*. We will need the following types - 

 - Field-Name: firstname, Field-Type: String
 - Field-Name: age, Field-Type: int32
 - Field-Name: city, Field-Type: String

Document Construction:
```
Upsert#Alice
{
  "firstname": "Alice",
  "age": 22
}

Upsert#Alice
{
  "firstname": "Alice",
  "city": "San Francisco"
}

Upsert#Bob
{
  "firstname": "Bob",
  "age": 25
}
```

Reads:
```
"Alice#firstname" -> "Alice"
"Alice#age" -> 22
"Alice#city" -> "San Francisco"

"Bob#firstname" -> "Bob"
"Bob#age" -> 25
"Bob#city" -> // empty
```
