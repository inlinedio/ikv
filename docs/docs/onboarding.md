# Onboarding
IKV is an **[embedded database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_database)** on top of a backend data layer (**IKV Cloud**). You need an IKV cloud account and a provisioned IKV store to start using it in your application.

:::info
All provisioning related communication can be done by contacting **onboarding@inlined.io**. Store provisioning takes 1-3 hours.
:::

## IKV Cloud Account
 - Allocate an `account-id` and `account-passkey` once for your account.
 - You can create any number of IKV stores under one account.

## IKV Store
Provision a new IKV store under your account by providing:
 - `store-name`: Unique name for your store
 - `primary-key`: A document field to identify documents that will be stored in IKV

## Pricing
Unlimited read quota, pay only for the amount of data you store ($ per GB/month). We offer a free-tier for small data volumes.

:::note
Pricing details can be requested based on quota requirements by contacting **onboarding@inlined.io**
